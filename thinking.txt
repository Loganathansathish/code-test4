Every Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home.
 There’s a lake located in one corner of the park. 
 Each time I jog by this lake, 
 I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s
  edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her.
   This past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me,
 so I stopped jogging
